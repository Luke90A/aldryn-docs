Boilerplates
============

Boilerplates are a set of default templates and staticfiles. A Boilerplate will typically
define how the django templates are structured and make opinionated choices about what
javascript frameworks to use and what CSS tools (SASS/LESS) are used.

Typically you don't need to create your own Boilerplate; just use one of the existing ones.
