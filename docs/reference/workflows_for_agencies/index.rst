Ownership and sharing
=====================


Agencies will likely have their own Addons that are developed by multiple developers.
We recommend to setup a shared agency account that owns all addons, Boilerplates and sites.
Then share the addons with all the developers that need access.


Sharing sites
-------------

Sites can be shared from the controlpanel. Select "Share Site".

Developers and Project Manager will typically need "Control panel access".
Customers usually only need access to the website and not the control panel.

To quickly show the stage site to someone without bothering with logins, the "Link to share"
can be used.


Sharing Addons
--------------

Typically addons will be shared with all Employees of the agency.

Developers will need the "Can use and update" Permission.
Project Managers will need the "Can only use" Permission.


Sharing Boilerplates
--------------------

In most cases you will not need to build your own Boilerplate. If you do, developers will
need full access and project managers read/use access.
