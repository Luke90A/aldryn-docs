There are a number of similar services available, so it's worth taking a moment to describe some of
the basics.

Aldryn is designed to meet the needs of three distinct groups of web professionals:

* content creators
* agencies and designers
* web application developers

In order to meet the multifarious and sometimes competing needs of these three groups, Aldryn
provides a suite of integrated tools and workflows.

**Content creators** are served by django CMS and the Aldryn Addons that can be installed. A number
of Addons already exist in the Aldryn Marketplace, but developers can readily develop and deploy
their own, from new or existing Django packages.

**Web agencies and designers** typically need to provide their clients with a site that the client
can subsequently manage on their own, working with tools and developers they are experienced with,
and able to work with rapidly. Aldryn provides flexible and effective ways of setting up sites so
that an agency can then hand over to clients, while still being able to retain oversight if
necessary. Future - or indeed continuous - development is possible, because Aldryn has been
designed to be a platform as much for hosting and site management as for development.

For **web application developers**, Aldryn provides a fully-featured Django environment. At the
same time it is a strongly-opinionated environment, which is of course necessary to permit it to
function as a cloud-based offering, that can be managed without difficulty by a non-technical user
using the Control Panel. Aldryn solves the problem of meeting these competing needs by making
possible **Local Development** in an environment (supported by tools that build it automaticallu)
that replicates the cloud environment.
