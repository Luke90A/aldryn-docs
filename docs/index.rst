Welcome to Aldryn
#################

`Aldryn`_ is a cloud-based platform for Django-based websites.

At the heart of Aldryn is `django CMS`_, a powerful and extensible open-source web content
management system, and a large and growing ecosystem of compatible applications.

Aldryn has been designed to meet the needs of three distinct groups of web professionals.


**Content creators**, who require an efficient and reliable way to produce content.

django CMS and the numerous Addons that can be installed make Aldryn a powerful content creation
platform. A number of Addons already exist in the Aldryn Marketplace, while developers can readily
develop and deploy their own, from new or existing Django packages.

**Web agencies and designers**, who work with multiple clients and content creators, and need to manage them all.

Typically they need to provide their clients with a site that the client can subsequently manage on
their own. Aldryn provides flexible and effective ways of setting up sites so that an agency can
then hand the, over to clients, while still being able to retain oversight if necessary. Future - or
indeed continuous - development is possible, because Aldryn has been designed to be a platform as
much for hosting and site management as for development.

**Web application developers**, who implement designs and create applications, and need a
low-friction workflow for their deployment.

Aldryn provides a fully-featured Django environment that can easily be recreated locally for
development.


The platform also provides:

* automated deployment
* hosting
* :doc:`shared team access </reference/workflows_for_agencies/index>`
* automated installation (including dependency management) and integration of
  third-party :term:`Addon` packages
* management via a web interface or desktop-based application
