Local Setup
===========

You can override the host it's talking to by setting the environment variable ``ALDRYN_HOST`` to something
(for example: http://localhost:8000). If you want to use the client locally, just invoke it like this:

``ALDRYN_HOST=http://localhost:8000 aldryn <command>``


Starting the GUI Application from the Commandline
