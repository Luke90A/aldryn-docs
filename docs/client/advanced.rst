Local Setup
===========

You can override the host that the client is talking to by setting
the environment variable ``ALDRYN_HOST`` to something
(for example: http://localhost:8000).
If you want to use the client locally, just invoke it like this:

``ALDRYN_HOST=http://localhost:8000 aldryn <command>``


Starting the GUI Application from the Commandline

.. ATTENTION::
  To be able to run the GUI version of the *Aldryn Application* you need to have
  `Kivy <http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html>`_ installed on your system.
