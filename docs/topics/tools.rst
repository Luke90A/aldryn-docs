=============
Control Panel
=============

The `Aldryn Control Panel <https://control.aldryn.com/control/>`_ is a web-based tool, and is the
primary management resource for Aldryn sites.

Most key features of the Control Panel are explained by the built-in **Tour**, but more advanced
features will be explained in the documentation for processes that require their use.

=================
The Aldryn Client
=================

The **Aldryn Client** is a command-line application. Key functions:

* **login**: the client can log you in to the Aldryn platform, to establish a direct connection
  between your local and the cloud environments
* **workspace replication**: replicate the cloud environment locally for development
* **file synchronisation**: aimed at front-end developers; allows local work on static files and
  assets
* **development management**: commands to validate and upload Addons and Boilerplates

======================
The Aldryn Desktop App
======================

Like the file synchronisation functions of the Aldryn Client, this is aimed at front-end
developers, and provides a graphical user interface for those functions.
